# Logistic-Regression-for-Kakao-Interview
For Kakao interview, I implemented logistic regression classifying non-linear two classes.
I refered to homework #2 of machine learning class (Coursera, Andrew Ng).
From the homework, gradient update using fminunc is modified to use loop.
This is MATLAB code, and you can start from jason_and_cat.m which is main part.
